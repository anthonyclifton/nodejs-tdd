# NodeJS Fizzbuzz TDD

Test drive Fizzbuzz as a REST service, implemented with
NodeJS.

## The Rules
* If input is a multiple of 3, return Fizz
* If input is a multiple of 5, return Buzz
* If input is a multiple of 15 (both 3 and 5), return Fizzbuzz
* Otherwise, return the input

## Running and Testing
* Clone repository
* Use WebStorm (or another IDE if you're comfortable) to
open the repository
* `npm install` to get dependencies
* `npm start` in one terminal window to start service
* `npm test` in another terminal window to run tests
* `npm run ci` to start the service, run tests, and then shut it down

Note: Right now, unit and integration tests are both run.
You can run tests individually or in suites within the
IDE.
